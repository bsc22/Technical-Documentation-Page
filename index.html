          <p>
            A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as
            people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers
            make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can
            be recovered at any time.
          </p>
          <p>Developers can review project history to find out:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which changes were made?</li>
            <li>Who made the changes?</li>
            <li>When were the changes made?</li>
            <li>Why were changes needed?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent view of a
            project, surfacing work that's already in progress. Seeing a
            transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they
            contribute to the development of a project helps team members stay
            aligned while working independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a distributed version control system, every developer has a full
            copy of the project and project history. Unlike once popular
            centralized version control systems, DVCSs don't need a constant
            connection to a central repository. Git is the most popular
            distributed version control system. Git is commonly used for both
            open source and commercial software development, with significant
            benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes,
              decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the
              moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all
              the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git,
              collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code
              integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes
              to production code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between
              teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git
              makes it possible to align experts across a business to
              collaborate on major projects.

        <article>
          <p>
            A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of
            files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's
            revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time
            called commits. The commits can be organized into multiple lines of
            development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are
            self-contained units and anyone who has a copy of the repository can
            access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line
            or other ease-of-use interfaces, a Git repository also allows for:
            interaction with the history, cloning the repository, creating
            branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of
            code, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities
            for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help
            teams work together to build the best possible final product.

        <article>
          <p>
            GitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to
            ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded
            discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection
            of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With
            collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million
            developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub
            changes the way software is built.
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process.
            Work is organized into repositories where developers can outline
            requirements or direction and set expectations for team members.
            Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to
            work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to
            propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone
            is on the same page. For more information, see "<a
              href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow"

        <header>GitHub and the command line</header>
        <header>Basic Git commands</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create,
            change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly
            from the command line or by using an application like GitHub
            Desktop. Here are some common commands for using Git:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span><code>git init</code></span> a brand new Git repository and
              begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder
              within the existing directory that houses the internal data
              structure required for version control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git clone</code></span> a local copy of a project that
              already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's
              files, history, and branches.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git add</code></span> a change. Git tracks changes to a
              developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a
              snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history.
              This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step
              process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the
              next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and
              committing separately gives developers complete control over the
              history of their project without changing how they code and work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git commit</code></span> the snapshot to the project history
              and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit
              functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with
              <span><code>git add</code></span> become a part of the snapshot with
              <span><code>git commit</code></span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git status</code></li></span> the status of changes as untracked,
              modified, or staged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git branch</code></span> the branches being worked on locally.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git merge</code></span> lines of development together. This
              command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct
              branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to
              combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for
              deployment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git pull</code></span> the local line of development with
              updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command
              if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they
              would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><code>git push</code></span> the remote repository with any
              commits made locally to a branch.
            </li>
          </ul>

            pushed to GitHub since the last time changes were made locally.
          </p>
          <code
            ># change into the `repo` directory
            <br />
            <span id="example">cd</span> repo
            <br />
            # update all remote tracking branches, and the currently checked out
            branch
            <br />
            git pull
            <br />
            # change into the existing branch called `feature-a`
            <br />
            git checkout feature-a
            <br />
            # make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` using the text editor
            <br />
            # stage the changed file
            <br />
            git add file1.md
            <br />
            # take a snapshot of the staging area
            <br />
            git commit -m "edit file1"
            <br />
            # push changes to github
            <br />

          <p>There are two primary ways people collaborate on GitHub:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shared repository</li>
            <li>Fork and pull</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With a shared repository, individuals and teams are explicitly
            designated as contributors with read, write, or administrator
            access. This simple permission structure, combined with features
            like protected branches, helps teams progress quickly when they
            adopt GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an open source project, or for projects to which anyone can
            contribute, managing individual permissions can be challenging, but
            a fork and pull model allows anyone who can view the project to
            contribute. A fork is a copy of a project under a developer's
            personal account. Every developer has full control of their fork and
            is free to implement a fix or a new feature. Work completed in forks
            is either kept separate, or is surfaced back to the original project
            via a pull request. There, maintainers can review the suggested
            changes before they're merged. For more information, see
